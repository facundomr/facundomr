### Hi, I'm Facu 👋

I'm an Android Engineer who works remotely from Argentina 🇦🇷. I enjoy contributing and building communities around the world. I work with Android, Kotlin, Firebase and some other technologies and tools building apps (since Android Donut! 🍩). I studied Computer Engineering. I organize my local GDG and Android communities in Buenos Aires.
